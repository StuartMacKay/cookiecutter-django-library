A list of issues, ideas, tasks and stuff for the project. Constantly changing,
evolving and occasionally thrown away and rewritten. In order of importance /
likelihood of getting worked on:

  other third-party providers:

    CircleCI
    AppVeyor
    ScrutinizerCI
    Coveralls
    Codacy

- [feature] Now that support for PyCharm has been added, what about support for:

    VSCode

- [documentation] document how .cookiecutterrc is used to create defaults.

- [decision] Add other app files:

  - AUTHORS.rst
  - CONTRIBUTING.rst

- [documentation] Create a "standard" outline for the app README.rst that h
  as all the useful/expected sections and takes a little part of the effort
  out of creating documentation.
