ToDo
----
A list of issues, ideas, tasks and stuff for the project. Constantly changing,
evolving and occasionally thrown away and rewritten.

* Backlog

  - look at flake8 plugins

  - Add template coverage

    https://pypi.org/project/django-coverage-plugin/

  - pyproject.toml, separate config files or setup.cfg for tool configuration

    find out more about pyproject.toml
    do all the tools used support it

    It's all a bit of a mess.

  - looks like `keywords` in setup.py might be a comma separated list.

  - add a makefile for windows?

  - document how .cookiecutterrc is used to create defaults.

  - Add configuration files for editors?

      PyCharm / Sublime / emacs / vim / etc.

  - Add other app files:

    - AUTHORS.rst
    - CONTRIBUTING.rst

  - Add an option to install tools like flake8 in --user space rather than
    having separate installs for each venv. You can still have completely
    isolated environments but it would be nice to upgrade things like flake8
    or pytest and have them updated for all venvs rather having to do it
    over and over again.

    It's not clear this is possible, when --site-system-packages is given
    pip might look in --user and then the site distribution but more research
    is needed: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4141

  - Add support for CI/CD and other third-party providers:

      CircleCI
      Travis
      AppVeyor
      ScrutinizerCI
      Coveralls
      Codacy

  - Add support for badges? Rather than just adding bling or wasting
    bandwidth look at whether badges provide useful info.

  - Create a "standard" outline for the app README.rst that has all the
    useful/expected sections and takes a little part of the effort out of
    creating documentation.

  - add url to setup.py?

    It's reported as being a required piece of metadata however it's
    another value to add to cookiecutter.json and the user might not
    have decided on where the code lives when the project is generated.

* Ready

  - Include building the documentation as part of the tests.

  - check the quickstart section in the top-level README.rst

* Done

  - Finished integration with Read The Docs.

  - Added a table describing all the configuration parameters to README.rst.

  - Using pip-tools to manage package version numbers is now optional.

  - The version number and release number in sphinx docs/conf.py is mow
    set correctly.

  - Added configuration options to sign_commits, sign_tags and sign_uploads
    so you don't forget to do it.

  - Got configuration for running tests with django test runner and tox working.

  - Added pytest and a test_runner option to the configuration to select which
    runner to use: django or pytest.

  - Removed the test directory from the root of the project. The tests run quite
    happily using the site settings so there's no need to maintain both.

  - Added support for coverage.

  - Added makefile targets for doing releases.

  - Added pyproject.toml for configuring black.
