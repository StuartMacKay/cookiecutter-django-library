============
Contributing
============

# This is an outline for a guide to making contributions to the project.
# Simply generating a standard-form guide as part of the template does
# not exactly send the message that contributions are welcome. In any
# case each project works a little differently so it's best if you write
# this guide yourself. The project wiki has some examples (eventually)
# of what contributors to this project consider to be good guidelines.
# Use these as a reference. It will make the task easier and the results
# will be a whole lot better. The following comments describe what each
# section in the outlines is for and gives an idea of the type of content
# it should contain.

# The introduction needs to be a clear statement that contributions are
# welcome. Set the tone you want here. The following sections then list
# the types of things you would like contributions for. It can be as
# wide-ranging or as narrow as you like. It you don't want to entertain
# feature requests and instead only want bug reports then be up front
# and say it. Diplomatically, of course ;)

Report Bugs
===========

# This is the most basic contribution, apart from asking for help, but
# it can be a time-sink as well. Make sure you list all the information
# you need to investigate a bug properly. The goal is to eliminate any
# back and fore with the contributor so you can start to look at the
# problem immediately. It also sets expectation with the contributor
# that any contribution needs to meet a minimum standard before it will
# entertained. Make sure you also make any limitations very clear, i.e.
# this does not work on Windows or needs python 3.8 or above.

Fix Bugs
========

# Not every bug in the issue tracker is necessarily open for contributions.
# if that is the case make sure you say that and make it explicit by adding
# a "Help wanted" label so there is no confusion.

Implement Features
==================

# This is the same story as fixing bugs. Also think about unsolicited
# features and how you would deal with them. Some will be really good but
# others might expand the scope of the project beyond what you want. It's
# best to be up front with what you are looking for and say it explicitly.
# That way to you should be able to manage the scope of incoming changes
# and make the whole thing manageable without upsetting anyone who spent
# months working on something you did not really want.

Write Documentation
===================

# Writing documentation is the low-hanging fruit for any project but
# writing good documentation is difficult. Beyond spelling corrections,
# anything else can be problematic. Maintaining the correct style from
# multiple contributors can be hard to and subjecting a contribution to
# heavy editing is also likely to be problematic. Rather than just solicit
# general changes or third-party items like articles or blog posts ask
# specifically whether your documentation is easy to understand and any
# instructions are easy to follow and more importantly repeatable.
# Generally you should get better better results than asking someone to
# write something as expansive as a tutorial or user guide.

Give Feedback
=============

# Just solicit general feedback, even if it is just a request for help
# in getting the project working. Usually this will just be a simple
# statement saying to create an entry in the issue tracker. This is also
# opportunity to direct request for help to other channels, e.g. IRC so
# your issue tracker does not fill up with requests for help.

Get Started!
============

# This section should contain all the steps needed to fork the repository,
# checkout the code, install all the dependencies and get the project
# running. Make sure you run them yourself to make sure everything is
# repeatable. Also include instructions on how to run the tests and any
# extra quality control steps that need to be applied, for example,
# running flake8, black or simple a spellchecker. The idea is to get
# a contribution to level where it can be submitted as a pull request.

Pull Requests
-------------

# This section contains the guidelines for making a pull request and
# hopefully getting it accepted. List all the things that need done before
# a pull request is going to get some attention. For example, adding tests,
# ensuring the tests are passing, documentation is added and the change log
# updated. Hopefully this will avoid any back and fore between you and the
# contributor before the change is ready to be reviewed in detail. On GitHub
# can also add a pull request template where all the requirements can be
# listed. Then this section just needs to reference that.
