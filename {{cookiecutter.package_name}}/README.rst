# The README should be the essential guide to your project. Everything
# the user needs to know on what it is, what it does and how to use it
# should be described here. This file is generally the first thing your
# next user sees when encountering your project so it's worth the time
# to put a little effort into it. Don't make it too short or too long.
# Instead leave all the extra information for supporting docs - unless
# the scope of your project is well defined and you really don't want
# to have to deal with writing other documents just for the sake of it.

Features
--------

# A list of features is always a good way of presenting what your project
# does. A simple list of things is sufficient but a better approach is to
# write the list in terms of the benefits. That way it's easier to see if
# the project meets someone's requirements. For example, the parent
# that generated this project uses pip-tools. Instead of saying "Uses
# pip-tools to manage requirements" you could say "Manage requirements
# and pin the version of numbers of dependencies with pip-tools". It's
# old saw of selling the sizzle not the steak. It also shows you put a
# little thought into the text which also probably means you put a little
# thought into the software too. Don't write an exhaustive list. Just show
# the main benefits. If there are only one or two, then great, it will
# easy for the user to see if this package is for them or not.

Quick start
-----------

# Describe all the steps the user has to make to get from installing the
# package through to having the code run. Stick to the basic actions, just
# enough get things working. Any additional detail, background information
# or caveats can be left to supporting documentation.
