Roadmap
=======

This is a CHANGELOG - for the future.

Upcoming
--------

The current feature set is sufficient for my needs so right now the focus
is on finding and fixing bugs, making everything work smoothly and general
polishing. Some areas that need some work are:

* The README.rst in the generated project is just a couple of titles. It
  would be a lot better if that could be fleshed out so it would remove
  any head-scratching of what a good README should have.

Existing cookiecutter templates are going to be trawled for good ideas. Any
contributions are, of course, extremely welcome
