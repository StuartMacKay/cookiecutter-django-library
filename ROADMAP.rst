Roadmap
=======

This is a CHANGELOG - for the future.

Upcoming
--------

The current feature set is sufficient for my needs so right now the focus
is on finding and fixing bugs, making everything work smoothly and general
polishing. Some areas that need some work are:

    * The developer notes are a bit thin. The use of a local .ccokiecuuterrc
      file is invaluable so you don't have to enter the parameters all the
      time. Using a dotenv file with an IDE or direnv also needs to be written
      up.

    * The README.rst in the generated project is just a couple of titles. It
      would be a lot better if that could be fleshed out so it would remove
      any head-scratching of what a good README should have.

There also needs to be a decision on other top-level files like AUTHORS.rst
or CONTRIBUTING.rst. These are generally useful but not universally. It's
easy to add parameters but then it's a trade-off between simplicity versus
and being comprehensive.

Existing cookiecutter templates are going to be trawled for good ideas. Any
contributions are, of course, extremely welcome
